üéØ **ENHANCEMENT TASK**:
Transform user feedback into precise, actionable instructions for game improvement.

üí¨ **User Feedback**:
"${input.prompt}"

üîß **Refinement Process**:
Analyze the feedback and create a comprehensive improvement instruction that:
- Identifies the specific issue or desired enhancement
- Provides clear technical direction for implementation
- Maintains the game's core appeal while addressing the concern
- Suggests additional polish that would enhance the overall experience

üìù **Output Format**:
Create a detailed instruction that the game AI can follow to implement the improvement. Include:
- Specific technical changes needed
- Visual/UX improvements to consider
- Any additional features that would complement the main request

Examples of good refinements:
- "Make the ball movement more responsive and add a subtle trail effect for better visual feedback"
- "Add a dynamic scoring system with combo multipliers and particle effects for score increases"
- "Implement smooth camera following with boundary constraints and add screen shake on impacts"

Deliver only the refined instruction, ready for the game generation AI.`;

3. **üé® Visual Design Direction**:
   - Art style and aesthetic theme (modern, retro, minimalist, etc.)
   - Color palette and mood (vibrant, dark, pastel, neon, etc.)
   - Visual effects and animations to include
   - UI/UX style and layout approach

4. **üéØ User Experience**:
   - Onboarding and tutorial approach
   - Feedback systems (visual, haptic, audio cues)
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Mobile vs desktop optimization

5. **üì± Technical Specifications**:
   - Control schemes for both desktop and mobile
   - Screen layouts and responsive design
   - Performance considerations
   - Browser compatibility requirements

6. **üåü Polish & Personality**:
   - Special effects and micro-interactions
   - Game personality and charm elements
   - Memorable moments and "wow" factors
   - Social sharing potential

üìù **Output**:
Create a comprehensive, inspiring game specification that will guide the AI to create a polished, engaging, and visually stunning game that exceeds expectations.
